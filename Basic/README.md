# MotionEyeOS_Add-On_Scripts
MotionEyeOS Add-On Scripts for Push Notifications (via Pushover) as well as ANPR/ALPR (via OpenALPR)

# Sites / APIs used in scripts

Open ALPR - https://cloud.openalpr.com/cloudapi/ 

Pushover - https://pushover.net

# Basic usage

1) userinit.sh goes in /data/etc/
2) pushover_boot.py goes in /data/
3) motion_alert.py goes in /data/
4) noimage.jpg goes in /data/output/

# pushover_boot.py - settings
-----------------------------

# APP_TOKEN = 'YOUR_APP_TOKEN'

Click on Register Application under the Your Applications heading on the Pushover website. Give your app a name – something like MotionEyeOS – and then make sure the type is Application. Give your app a description (e.g. ‘Push notifications for MotionEyeOS’) and, if you want, upload an icon which will show in your Pushover client app whenever a notification is sent.

Once you have created your application, you should have access to an API token/key.  You will need this app token as well as your user key.

# USER_KEY = 'YOUR_USER_KEY'

Your User Key is shown at the top right of your dashboard after logging in.

# HTML = '1'

0 = Plain text only.
1 = You can use some basic html. 

See here for more: https://pushover.net/api#html

# TITLE = 'MotionEyeOS (Re)booted'

Set to whatever you would like your notification TITLE to say

# MESSAGE = '<b>RPiZeroW_CAM2</b><br><br>This camera device has just (re)booted and is now up and running'

This is the content of your notification message.

# URL = '' 

Enter a URL link you would like to include in the notification.  This is handy if, for example, you have port forwarding set so you can access your camera externally.  For example: http://mycctvcamera.domain.com

# URL_TITLE = ''

This is the text shown in the notification for the above url link

# SOUND = 'cosmic'

If you want, you can specficy a specific sound to be played for this notification.  

See more here: https://pushover.net/api#sounds






# motion_alert.py - settings
----------------------------

# Shared Settings

# PUSHOVER = 1 

If set to 1, it will use pushover and send a notification.  If set to 0 it won't

# OPENALPR = 1

If set to 1, the captured still image will be sent to the OpenALRP Cloud API for Number Plate Recognition

# NETWORK_SHARE = 1 

If you are using a network share instead of local storage, set this boolean to 1.
0 means you are using local storage

# SHARE_FOLDER = '/data/media/motioneye_192_168_0_200_storage_sda1_front_cctv_rpizerow_cam2__admin/' 

Set your shared folder path here.  After setting up your shared storage in MotionEye, you can see find the "alias" by using ssh terminal or sftp for example, to goto the /data/media folder.  Then use ls (if using ssh terminal) to see the directory.  If using SFTP it should be obvious.  I left my path in there as an example.

# FIND_LATEST_FILE = 1

Set this to 1 if you intend to run a custom script or some other actions to locate the latest file.  Primarily only really needed if using network share, since the lastsnap.jpg isn't created when using a network share.

# debug = 1 

Obviously debugging & print statements are only useful if you're running this script manually before setting it as your motion detected notification command.

# Pushover Settings - https://pushover.net 
(I won't explain these again, these are the same as used in pushover_boot.py)

APP_TOKEN = 'YOUR_APP_TOKEN'

USER_KEY = 'YOUR_USER_KEY'

HTML = '1' # This is a STRING - NOT a boolean! 0 = plain text, 1 = HTML

TITLE = 'MotionEyeOS - Motion Detected'

MESSAGE = '<b>RPiZeroW_CAM2</b><br><br>'

URL = ''

URL_TITLE = ''

SOUND = 'pushover' # default = pushover. https://pushover.net/api#sounds


# OpenALPR Cloud API Settings - https://cloud.openalpr.com/cloudapi/


# SECRET_KEY = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'

Your secret key can be found in your OpenALPR API page - https://cloud.openalpr.com/cloudapi/

# COUNTRY_CODE = 'COUNTRY_CODE'

Set this to your country code.  This is used by OpenALPR to help it recognise plates in pictures.  EU = Europe, GB = Great Britain (aka UK), US = America.

A full list of supported country codes can be found here
https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/tree/master/runtime_data/config

# RECOGNIZE_VEHICLE = '1'

This is a STRING value.  If set to 1, the vehicle will also be recognized in the image
This requires an additional credit per request.  If set to 0, only the plate is returned.

0 costs 1 API credit, 1 costs 2 API Credits.  FREE Accounts get 2000 API Credits per month.

# VEHICLE_DETAILS_IN_PUSHOVER = 1

Boolean.  If set to 1, the vehicle details in the push notification - such as reg, make, model, year will be included in the notification (details depend on the option above).

# save_results = 1 

Boolean.  Do you want save the json results that OpenALPR returns.  May be useful for debugging or general curiosity to see confidence values of the returned results.

# save_filename = 'results.json'

Filename to save the results to

# print_response = 0

Print out the results - may be useful when running the script manually to see output.
